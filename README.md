The application is built using React. To run the app, follow these steps:

Pull the code from the GitHub repository using the following link: [GitHub Repository Link]
Open the code with VS Code or any other code editor of your choice.
Navigate to the project directory in the terminal or command prompt.
Run the following command to install the dependencies: npm install
After the installation is complete, you can start the application by running: npm start

This will launch the application locally, and you can access it via your web browser.

I have created a GitHub repository to host the project code. You can access the repository using the following link:
